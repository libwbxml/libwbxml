Making a release
================

To make a release of libwbxml, do the following:

 - check out a fresh copy from github

 - increment the version numbers in ./CMakeLists.txt: 

   Package Version:
   LIBWBXML_VERSION_MAJOR
   LIBWBXML_VERSION_MINOR
   LIBWBXML_VERSION_PATCH

   Library Version:
   LIBWBXML_LIBVERSION_AGE 
    * Increment if any interface changed since last release.

   LIBWBXML_LIBVERSION_REVISION
    * Increment if any library code changed since last release.
      Set to 0 if any interface  has been changed since last release.

   LIBWBXML_LIBVERSION_AGE
    * Reset to 0 if any interface has been removed since last release.
      If any interface has been added then increment.


 - Run "make test" again several times to try to see race conditions.
   "cd trunk"
   "cmake . -B/tmp/build/libwbxml"
   "cd /tmp/build/libwbxml"
   "make"
   "make test"

 - Commit and push the increased version changes (and build fixes)

 - if someone else made changes and the push fails,
   you have to "git pull" and run the tests again

 - please run "git status" before you continue to be 100 percent sure
   that there is no forgotten commit and no unrevisioned file.

 - Check ChangeLog to be complete and add the new release name.

 - Once the commit succeeds, you have to create a new release on GitHub.
   Please use the web GUI of Github and write some useful release notes. 

 - create tarballs for an out-of-source-build with
   "cmake . -B/tmp/build/libwbxml-$MAJOR.$MINOR.$PATCH",
   "cd /tmp/build/libwbxml-$MAJOR.$MINOR.$PATCH",
   "make package_source"

 - write checksums with md5sum from the tarballs to a file with the
   same name like the tarballs without the tar and compression suffixes
   and plus a new suffix md5sum
   Example:
     md5sum libwbxml-$MAJOR.$MINOR.$PATCH.tar.* > libwbxml-$MAJOR.$MINOR.$PATCH.md5sum
     md5sum -c libwbxml-$MAJOR.$MINOR.$PATCH.md5sum
     sha512sum libwbxml-$MAJOR.$MINOR.$PATCH.tar.* > libwbxml-$MAJOR.$MINOR.$PATCH.sha512sum
     sha512sum -c libwbxml-$MAJOR.$MINOR.$PATCH.sha512sum

 - upload the tarballs and the checksum file to the File Release System
   of SourceForge via the web interface
