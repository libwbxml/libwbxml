Making a release
================

To make a release of libwbxml, do the following:

 - check out a fresh copy from subversion

 - increment the version numbers in ./CMakeLists.txt: 

   Package Version:
   LIBWBXML_VERSION_MAJOR
   LIBWBXML_VERSION_MINOR
   LIBWBXML_VERSION_PATCH

   Library Version:
   LIBWBXML_LIBVERSION_AGE 
    * Increment if any interface changed since last release.

   LIBWBXML_LIBVERSION_REVISION
    * Increment if any library code changed since last release.
      Set to 0 if any interface  has been changed since last release.

   LIBWBXML_LIBVERSION_AGE
    * Reset to 0 if any interface has been removed since last release.
      If any interface has been added then increment.


 - Run "make test" again several times to try to see race conditions.
   "cd trunk"
   "cmake . -B/tmp/build/libwbxml"
   "cd /tmp/build/libwbxml"
   "make"
   "make test"

 - Commit the increased version changes (and build fixes)

 - if someone else made changes and the commit fails,
   you have to "svn up" and run the tests again

 - please run "svn status" before you continue to be 100 percent sure
   that there is no forgotten commit and no unrevisioned file.

 - please run 'find . -name "svn-commit*.tmp" -print' to detect
   waste from failed commits.

 - once the commit succeeds, you have to create a new tag with
   "mkdir tags/libwbxml-$MAJOR.$MINOR.$PATCH",
   'tar -C trunk --exclude="\.svn" -cf - . | tar -C tags/libwbxml-$MAJOR.$MINOR.$PATCH -xf -'
   "svn add tags/libwbxml-$MAJOR.$MINOR.$PATCH" and
   "svn commit tags/libwbxml-$MAJOR.$MINOR.$PATCH trunk"
   (NEVER use "svn cp" because you must replace the external entities
   of the trunk directory with hard copies of the actual state.)

 - create tarballs for an out-of-source-build with
   "cmake tags/libwbxml-$MAJOR.$MINOR.$PATCH -B/tmp/build/libwbxml-$MAJOR.$MINOR.$PATCH",
   "cd /tmp/build/libwbxml-$MAJOR.$MINOR.$PATCH",
   "make package_source"

 - write checksums with md5sum from the tarballs to a file with the
   same name like the tarballs without the tar and compression suffixes
   and plus a new suffix md5sum
   Example:
     md5sum libwbxml-$MAJOR.$MINOR.$PATCH.tar.* > libwbxml-$MAJOR.$MINOR.$PATCH.md5sum
     md5sum -c libwbxml-$MAJOR.$MINOR.$PATCH.md5sum
     sha512sum libwbxml-$MAJOR.$MINOR.$PATCH.tar.* > libwbxml-$MAJOR.$MINOR.$PATCH.sha512sum
     sha512sum -c libwbxml-$MAJOR.$MINOR.$PATCH.sha512sum

 - upload the tarballs and the checksum file to the File Release System
   of SourceForge via the web interface

 - Annouce the release on the mailing list
   Tips: 
     * make diff of the exported symbols "nm -g -P libwbxml.so"
     * read svn log
     * check trac tickets which are attached to the according milestone
